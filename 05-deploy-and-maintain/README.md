## 🔒 Security Setup

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
```dax
// Example RLS Rule
[SalesRep] = USERNAME() || 
USERPRINCIPALNAME() = "manager@company.com"
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Create Roles
   - Define security rules
   - Test with different users
   - Document access patterns

2. Manage Access
   - Assign users to roles
   - Monitor access
   - Regular audits

## 🌐 Gateway Configuration

### Gateway Types
1. Personal Gateway
   - Individual use
   - Local testing
   - Development

2. Enterprise Gateway
   - Organization-wide
   - High availability
   - Scheduled refresh

### Setup Process
1. Installation
   - System requirements
   - Network configuration
   - Service account

2. Configuration
   - Data sources
   - Credentials
   - Refresh settings

## 📈 Performance Management

### Monitoring
1. Performance Metrics
   - Query times
   - Refresh duration
   - Resource usage

2. Usage Statistics
   - User activity
   - Report views
   - Dataset usage

### Optimization
1. Dataset
   - Incremental refresh
   - Aggregations
   - Partitioning

2. Reports
   - Visual optimization
   - Query reduction
   - Cache settings

## 🔄 Deployment Pipeline

### Stages
1. Development
   - Content creation
   - Testing
   - Documentation

2. Test
   - User acceptance
   - Performance testing
   - Security validation

3. Production
   - Final deployment
   - Monitoring
   - Support

### Best Practices
1. Version Control
   - Change tracking
   - Rollback plans
   - Documentation

2. Testing Protocol
   - Data accuracy
   - Performance
   - Security

## 👩‍💻 Practical Tasks

### Basic Setup
1. Create workspace
   - Set permissions
   - Configure settings
   - Add members

### Security Implementation
