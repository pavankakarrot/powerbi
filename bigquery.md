## 1. Project Conversation Starter

<div align="left">

> **Boss:** (*probably after a coffee, because these requests always come after coffee*)  
> We need to figure out how our ads are doing and whatâ€™s working or not. I want insights that help us improve ROI and make better decisions.

<br>

**Me:** Got it! Let me confirm a few details to ensure I deliver exactly what you need. Are we focusing on specific campaigns, or do you want an overall analysis?

<br>

> **Boss:** Start with an overall analysis, then dive into the major campaigns driving the most traffic or spend.

<br>

**Me:** Understood. I'll analyze campaign performance metrics like clicks, impressions, conversions, and costs. For devices, I'll evaluate performance by type, including conversion rates and cost efficiency. I'll also assess landing page. Lastly, I'll segment the audience by demographics such as age and gender. Does this cover your requirements?

<br>

> **Boss:** Yes, sounds perfect. Can you make sure the insights are actionable and include recommendations?

<br>

**Me:** Absolutely! Iâ€™ll prepare a report with data visualizations and clear recommendations to optimize campaigns and improve ROI.

<br>

> **Boss:** Great. Letâ€™s touch base by Friday to review the findings.

## 3. Data Collection

Before we dive into making those fancy charts, let's make sure our data isn't playing tricks on us. Think of this as a health check-up for our data - but don't worry, no needles involved!

Navigate to Bigquery--> GoogleAds Dataset and pick the required data tables by verifying schema. 

#### Tables I Picked
```
Our Tables:
ðŸ“Š CampaignStats - The star of our show
ðŸ“Š Demographics  - Who's who in our ad world
ðŸ“Š LandingPages  - Where people end up
ðŸ“Š AgesRange  - Which age range end up
```

## 4. Data Quality Assessment & Completeness


### 4.1. Record Count Analysis

```sql
-- Check daily record counts to identify missing dates or unusual patterns
WITH daily_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        segments_date,
        COUNT(*) as record_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT campaign_id) as campaign_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as customer_count
    FROM `ga4powerbi-2024.GoogleAds.p_ads_CampaignStats_5917066896`
    WHERE segments_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
    GROUP BY segments_date
)
SELECT 
    segments_date,
    record_count,
    campaign_count,
    customer_count,
    LAG(record_count) OVER (ORDER BY segments_date) as prev_day_records,
    ROUND(ABS(record_count - LAG(record_count) OVER (ORDER BY segments_date)) / 
          LAG(record_count) OVER (ORDER BY segments_date) * 100, 2) as daily_change_percentage
FROM daily_counts
ORDER BY segments_date DESC;
```

| Date       | Records | Campaigns | Customers | Prev Day Records | Daily Change % |
|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| 2024-10-18 | 41      | 6         | 1         | 59              | 30.51         |
| 2024-10-17 | 59      | 6         | 1         | 59              | 0.00          |
| 2024-10-16 | 59      | 6         | 1         | 51              | 15.69         |

##### Key Insights:

- ***Campaign Expansion:*** There was a strategic increase in campaign count from 5 to 6 between Oct 15-16, though this didn't immediately translate to higher record counts. This suggests possible optimization period for new campaigns.
- ***Volume Volatility:*** Record counts show significant daily fluctuations, with the highest daily change being 30.51% drop (Oct 17-18). The average daily volume is around 55 records, making the Oct 18 count (41) notably below average, indicating a potential anomaly or campaign performance issue requiring investigation.

        COUNTIF(metrics_impressions IS NULL) as null_impressions,
        COUNTIF(metrics_conversions IS NULL) as null_conversions,
        COUNTIF(segments_device IS NULL) as null_devices
    FROM `ga4powerbi-2024.GoogleAds.p_ads_CampaignStats_5917066896`
    WHERE segments_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
)
SELECT 
    ROUND(null_campaign_ids / total_records * 100, 2) as campaign_id_null_pct,
    ROUND(null_clicks / total_records * 100, 2) as clicks_null_pct,
    ROUND(null_impressions / total_records * 100, 2) as impressions_null_pct,
    ROUND(null_conversions / total_records * 100, 2) as conversions_null_pct,
    ROUND(null_devices / total_records * 100, 2) as devices_null_pct
FROM field_stats;
```
| Metric              | Null % |
|--------------------|--------|
| Campaign ID        | 0.0    |
| Clicks             | 0.0    |
| Impressions        | 0.0    |
| Conversions        | 0.0    |
| Devices            | 0.0    |

#### Key Insights:

```
<br>
<br>

### Create Base Tables (Facts & Dimensions)

We create facts & dimension tables to make complex data dimple to understand, speeds up report generation, & to make ensure data consistency. 

***Facts Table:*** It stores the measurable, quantitative data for the business. It typically contains metrics (also called facts) that can be analyzed or aggregated. Itâ€™s the central point for quantitative analysis.

***Dimension Tables:*** It store descriptive or categorical data that provides context to the facts stored in the fact table. They contain information that answers the "who," "what," "where," "when," and "how" of a business event. Itâ€™s used for filtering, grouping, and slicing the data.

Combination of both tables enables efficient and flexible analysis and reporting.



```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Campaign Stats] --> B[Daily performance metrics];
    A --> C[Click and impression data];

    J[Landing Pages] --> K[URL tracking];
    J --> L[Domain analysis];
    J --> M[Path information];
```

<br>
<br>


#### Temporary Campaign Stats Fact Table

```sql
-- 1. Create temporary campaign stats table with Euro conversion
-- Note: metrics_cost_micros is in millionths of the account's currency (Euro for Ireland)
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_fact_campaign_performance AS
SELECT
    campaign_id,
    customer_id,
    segments_date,
    segments_device,
    segments_click_type,
    metrics_clicks,
    metrics_impressions,
    metrics_conversions,
    metrics_cost_micros,
    -- Convert micros to Euros (divide by 1,000,000)
    ROUND(metrics_cost_micros/1000000, 2) as cost_eur

WHERE segments_date >= analysis_start_date;
```
<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Demographics Dimesion Table

```sql
-- 2. Create temporary demographics table (unchanged)
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_dim_demographics AS
SELECT 
    d1.campaign_id,
    d1.ad_group_criterion_gender_type as gender,

## 6. Data Processing & Cleaning
Ensure data integrity through validation by checking for completeness, verifying metric accuracy, and maintaining relationship integrity. Clean the data by standardizing formats, handling missing values, and fixing inconsistencies. Enhance the data by adding calculated fields, creating lookup tables, and optimizing for efficient reporting.

#### Create Optimized & Cleaned Tables


Yes, I understand! You want to combine the key processing steps and activities into a single point for each table (fact or dimension), summarizing the relevant steps. Here's how that can be structured:

1. Campaign Performance Table (Fact Table)
Key Processing Steps: Validate completeness and metric accuracy, ensure relationship integrity; Clean campaign metrics, handle missing values, and fix inconsistencies; Enhance by adding calculated fields, performance indicators, and optimizing for reporting (e.g., including time dimensions).
2. Demographics Lookup Table (Dimension Table)
Key Processing Steps: Validate completeness and accuracy of demographic data (age, gender, targeting info); Clean by standardizing formats and addressing missing values; Enhance by combining age and gender data, creating demographic segments, and adding targeting information.
3. Landing Page References Table (Dimension Table)
Key Processing Steps: Validate completeness and correctness of URL and domain data; Clean by handling missing or inconsistent data; Enhance by structuring URL information, categorizing domains, and tracking page performance for reporting purposes.

<br>
<br>

```sql
-- 4. Create temporary cleaned performance table with Euro metrics
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_clean_campaign_performance AS
WITH validated_data AS (
    SELECT 
        campaign_id,
        customer_id,
        segments_date,
        segments_device,
        metrics_clicks,
        metrics_impressions,
        metrics_conversions,
        cost_eur,  -- Using Euro cost
        CASE 
            WHEN metrics_clicks > metrics_impressions THEN FALSE
            WHEN cost_eur < 0 THEN FALSE
            WHEN metrics_impressions = 0 THEN FALSE
            ELSE TRUE
        END as is_valid_record
    FROM temp_fact_campaign_performance
)
SELECT 
    campaign_id,
    customer_id,
    segments_date,
    segments_device,
    COALESCE(metrics_clicks, 0) as clicks,
    COALESCE(metrics_impressions, 0) as impressions,
    COALESCE(metrics_conversions, 0) as conversions,
    COALESCE(cost_eur, 0) as cost_eur,  -- Euro cost
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM segments_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM segments_date) as month,
    FORMAT_DATE('%A', segments_date) as day_of_week
FROM validated_data
WHERE is_valid_record = TRUE;
```
