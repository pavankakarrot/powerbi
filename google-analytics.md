  - Parameters: `transaction_id`, `value`, and `items` for detailed transaction data.  
  - Attribution: Data-driven models ensure accurate credit allocation.  
- **Leads**:  
  - Forms: Tracks form interactions to measure lead generation.
  - Contact: Tracks user engagement with contact methods for follow-up opportunities.  

#### **Custom Events**  
Tailored events to track unique user actions and business KPIs:  
- **User Journey**: Includes tracking key steps such as product views, add-to-cart actions, and checkout steps.  
- **Engagement**: Measures specific interactions like video plays, blog reads, and tool usage.  
- **Business Metrics**: Tracks essential actions like pricing page views.

## 7. Technical Challenges And Solutions

### 7.1 Tackling Data Accuracy Challenges  

#### **Duplicate Events**  
- **The Problem**: Events firing multiple times, leading to inflated metrics.  
- **The Solution**: Implemented a **debounce mechanism** to prevent redundant event triggers.  
- **The Impact**: Achieved a **98% reduction in duplicate events**, ensuring cleaner and more reliable data.  

#### **Misattribution**  
- **The Problem**: Inconsistent attribution across devices caused fragmented user journeys.  
- **The Solution**: Introduced **User ID tracking**, enabling seamless cross-device attribution.  
- **The Impact**: Gained **85% clarity** in mapping user journeys, boosting attribution accuracy.  

#### **Data Loss**  
- **The Problem**: Data gaps due to script loading failures during user interactions.  
- **The Solution**: Deployed a **Google Tag Manager (GTM) strategy** to ensure robust tracking.  
- **The Impact**: Secured a **99.9% data capture rate**, eliminating data loss issues.  

This proactive approach transformed data reliability, empowering stakeholders with accurate insights for confident decision-making.
