## 1. Project Overview
In this entrepreneurial venture, I conceptualized, launched, and scaled a Shopify-based e-commerce store specializing in personalized gifts. The project demonstrated the power of combining strategic marketing with efficient operations to build a profitable online business from scratch.

### Initial Goals
When I kicked off this project, we set some ambitious but achievable targets for our first 6 months:
- ***Revenue Target:*** We aimed to hit €2,000 in revenue within the first 6 months
- ***Operations Excellence:*** Maintain a 95% success rate in order fulfillment by keeping our customer satisfaction rating above 4.5 stars
- ***Marketing Efficiency:*** Keep our cost of acquiring each new customer under €15

## 4. Store Development & Optimization

I designed our store with three key priorities: user experience, performance, and conversion optimization. Here's how I structured it:

**Store Layout & Design**
- Built a dynamic homepage that showcases our best products in real-time
- Created interactive product pages where customers can customize their items
- Streamlined the checkout into a single, friction-free page

**Performance Focus**
- Adopted a mobile-first approach since most of our customers shop on phones
- Achieved lightning-fast load times (under 2 seconds)
- Implemented advanced image optimization to keep pages loading quickly while maintaining quality

**Conversion Optimization**
- Enhanced revenue through strategic product recommendations:
  - "You Might Also Like" related products section
  - Money-saving bundle offers
  - Smart cross-sell suggestions
- Set up automated cart recovery to win back abandoned purchases

## 5. Marketing Strategy Implementation

We built a strategic three-tier marketing funnel to guide customers from discovery to purchase, with carefully allocated budgets for each stage:

 **Awareness Stage (€150/month)**
- Where we first connect with potential customers
- Focused on Facebook for maximum reach
- Content Strategy:
  - Engaging product showcase posts
- Largest budget allocation to cast a wide net

 **Consideration Stage (€75/month)**
- Targeting people who've shown interest
- Re-engaging two key groups:
  - Recent store visitors
  - People who left items in cart
- Messaging focused on:
  - Highlighting our custom design options
  - Suggesting perfect gift ideas
- Moderate budget to nurture interested prospects

**Conversion Stage (€25/month)**
- Final push to secure sales
- Precisely targeting:
  - Visitors who viewed multiple products
  - Previous customers for repeat business
- Compelling offers:
  - Time-sensitive deals
  - Free shipping promotions
- Smaller budget as audience is highly qualified
